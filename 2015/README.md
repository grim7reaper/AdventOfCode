Santa was hoping for a white Christmas, but his weather machine's "snow"
function is powered by stars, and he's fresh out! To save Christmas, he needs
you to collect _fifty stars_ by December 25th.

Collect stars by helping Santa solve puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available
on each day in the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you
complete the first. Each puzzle grants _one star_. Good luck!
