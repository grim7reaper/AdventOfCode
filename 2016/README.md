Santa's sleigh uses a very high-precision clock to guide its movements, and the
clock's oscillator is regulated by stars. Unfortunately, the stars have been
stolenâ€¦ by the Easter Bunny. To save Christmas, Santa needs you to retrieve all
_fifty stars_ by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day
in the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the
first. Each puzzle grants _one star_. Good luck!
